## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate secure and transparent transactions in the real estate token market. By leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contracts, we aim to streamline the process and ensure that all parties involved in a transaction are protected.

## Roles

The Escrow system is designed with four distinct roles:

1. **Buyer**: The individual or entity looking to purchase real estate tokens.
2. **Seller**: The owner of the real estate token who wishes to sell it.
3. **Lender**: Provides financial support or loans to the buyer for purchasing the real estate token.
4. **Inspector**: Responsible for verifying the authenticity and condition of the real estate linked to the token. They play a crucial role in ensuring that the token's value corresponds to the actual value of the real estate.
